### Hi, I'm Bharath ðŸ‘‹

I am a 4th year PhD student in theoretical physics at the University of Geneva and a COAS at CERN Geneva. I am currently at Caltech as a visiting PhD student.

At the moment, allowed boundary conditions in two dimensional conformal field theories keeps me awake during the day, and ML alignment keeps me awake during the night. In the past I have dabbled in the [stringy aspects of AdS/CFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05115) and [flat space holography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07649). To see more about my work, I invite you to visit my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8BDAnVAAAAAJ&hl=en) profile.

<!--
I like to do a lot of mini projects as a way to understand how a lot of the software I use on a daily basis works. You can find all of them in the [miniX](https://github.com/bharathr98/minix) repository. Some illustrative samples of these are 
 - [miniLLM](https://github.com/bharathr98/minillm) - An annotated implementation of Transformers from [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) using PyTorch.
 - [minigrep](https://github.com/bharathr98/minigrep) - An implementation of `grep`, which uses the Boyer-Moore string search algorithm. Written in C.
 - [minitorch](https://github.com/bharathr98/minitorch) - An implementation of strided tensors, a key datastructure used for multidimensional data and famously used in PyTorch and Boost.MultiArray. Written in C++.

Please be aware that these are projects to understand the concept behind something and thus are not meant to be replacements. Please be sensible enough to not use them in any production environment.

**bharathr98/bharathr98** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
